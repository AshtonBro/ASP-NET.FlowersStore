        We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would 
        be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening (for example, using Internet Explorer select 
        'internet options' from the 'tools' menu, then click 'security', followed by 'custom level' and select 'disable cookies').
        The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings.
        Cookies are also used as a further means of ensuring private and secure purchase sessions are operated within the site.
        Every time you connect to our website we store a log of your visit which shows the unique number your machine uses when it is
        connected to the internet (IP address). This tells us what you looked at; whether the page request was successful or not and which
        browser you use to view the pages. The use of this data is strictly for statistical purposes only. This helps us to understand which
        areas of the site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. It also tells how many people are visiting
        the website in total.<br />
        <br />
        Data collected will not be shared with any other companies.<br />
        <br />
        We may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by email or an announcement on the website.<br />

        If you have any questions/comments about privacy, you should email us.<br />
